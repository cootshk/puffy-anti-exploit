# Minecraft abstracts the interact packet's type away to enable a highly polymorphic handling system which allows the
# packet to be handled automatically without the need for a procedural check for things like "should this be an attack?" "are we trading a villager?"
# However, since we want to intercept attack packets and not handle them, we must open this field unfortunately.
