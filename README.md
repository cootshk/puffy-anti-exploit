# puffy-anti-exploit üîç

PAE (puffy anti exploit) is a simple server-side anti-exploit which aims to prevent the usage of certain unfair cheats.
PAE does not try to ban/moderate players, it only tries to reduce the amount of possible exploitation on the
server--kicking if necessary.
Right now, it supports preventing these cheats (and any of their derivatives):

- Flight
    - Boat Fly
    - Elytra Fly
    - Elytra Boost
- Speed
    - Long Jump **(not in all cases)**
- KillAura
- Hitboxes *(also known as a Hitbox Expander)*
